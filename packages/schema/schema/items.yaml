  ItemIDs:

      Different IDs assigned to this item, for example

      For most addons, it is recommended to use the addon
      ID as key for `ids`, for example:
      `{ 'example-addon': 'someid12345' }`.
      However, the key `id` will be internally translated to
      the addon ID, so `{ id: 'someid12345' }` is the same
      as above.
